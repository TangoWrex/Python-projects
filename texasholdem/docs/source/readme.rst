Operations
==========


**Purpose:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Texas holdem is a 1 vs 1-8 computer player game.
the game randomly generates your cards. you're able to to bet
$1 - $1000. at the end of the game all cards are shown and a winner
is returned


**challenges and successes:**
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was successful with creating my deck and creating my players in a dictionary
I was able to accomplish that fairly quickly and felt confident in using functions to pass the data
throughout my program. 

it was very challenging to use the lambdas and combination to check the different combinations
against the functions in RankTheHand.py. 

Unfortunately, I could not figure out how toget my program to pick a winner.
